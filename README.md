# FPGA-Accel-Emulator

## Overview

FPGA-Accel-Emulator is an FPGA-based project designed to emulate the functionality of accelerometers, such as the ADXL362, while providing additional capabilities for direct FIFO data writing and UART to SPI conversion. This setup allows for efficient simulation and testing of motion data without overloading the MCU's SPI bus.
